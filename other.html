                <h2>MCM</h2>
                <p>The Mathematical Competition in Modeling (MCM) is an annual competition hosted by
                    the Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP). The goal of the
                    competition is to solve one of two provided problems and write a paper-like
                    solution to the chosen problem. Below are the details of the two years I
                    participated in the competition.</p>
                    <p> Please be mindful of the fact that these solutions were prepared over the
                    course of only four days, so there will be typos and incomplete sections to
                    our solutions.</p>

                    <h3>2016 - A Hot Bath</h3>
                    <p> A collaboration with <a href="http://nathanmull.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Mull</a> and Stephen Lu.
                    This year we submitted a solution to <a href="http://www.immchallenge.org/mcm/2016_MCM_Problem_A.pdf" target="_blank">Problem
                    A</a>. Here's a quick summary of the problem:</p>

                    <p style="margin-left:40px; color:#000; font-style:italic">
                    A person fills up a bathtub with hot water. Since the tub will naturally cool
                    down and have an uneven temperature throughout, develop a model of the bathtub
                    water and use that model to come up with a strategy to help the person keep the
                    original temperature they filled the tub with and the water temperature as even
                    throughout the tub as possible, without wasting too much water.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is our full, unedited <a href="mcm2016.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">[solution]</a>.
                    On a high-level, our solution is to model the bath tub with a set of PDE's and
                    find the approximate solution to the boundary value problem with the finite element
                    method (FEM). Then, using this approximate solution, use a hybrid model of the
                    bath-taking experience to generate optimal control for a user with control over
                    the faucet flow rate, faucet temperature, and moving to the front and back of the
                    tub.</p>

                    <p>The toolboxes we used were MATLAB's <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/pde/" target="_blank">PDE
                    Toolbox</a> and the <a href="http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/hybrid/toolbox/" target="_blank">Hybrid
                    Toolbox</a> for
                    MATLAB.</p>

                    <p> A collaboration with <a href="http://nathanmull.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Mull</a> and Stephen Lu.
                    This year we submitted a solution to <a href="https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2015/problems/" target="_blank">Problem
                    B</a>. Here's the problem statement (from the MCM website):</p>

                    <p style="margin-left:40px; color:#000; font-style:italic">
                    Recall the lost Malaysian flight MH370. Build a generic mathematical model that
                    could assist "searchers" in planning a useful search for a lost plane feared to
                    have crashed in open water such as the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern, or
                    Arctic Ocean while flying from Point A to Point B. Assume that there are no
                    signals from the downed plane. Your model should recognize that there are many
                    different types of planes for which we might be searching and that there are many
                    different types of search planes, often using different electronics or sensors.
                    Additionally, prepare a 1-2 page non-technical paper for the airlines to use in
                    their press conferences concerning their plan for future searches.

                    Our solution to this problem is a formulation for a probabilistic simulation of the
                    plane's location. The idea is that by running this simulation which was built on
                    our model of the dynamics of both a plane in the air and floating in the ocean
                    search pilots could begin their searches from high probability peak locations.
