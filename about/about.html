                        <h2>Me (On the left)</h2>
                        <p> I was born in South Carolina (I have no memories of the state)
                        and raised in Tucson, Arizona. In 2012, I graduated from Catalina
                        Foothills High School. In 2016, I obtained my B.S. in
                        electrical engineering and computer science at the University of
                        California, Berkeley.</p>

                        <p>Following graduation, I have been spending my time as a full-time
                        researcher in the <a href="http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/index.html" target='_blank'>
                        Hybrid Systems Laboratory</a> under the guidance of
                        <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tomlin/" target='blank'>Professor Claire Tomlin</a>.
                        I also spent a month as a visiting scholar at the School of Automation in
                        Huazhong University of Science of Technology with <a href="https://yy311.github.io/" target='_blank'>
                        Professor Ye Yuan</a> to set up a quadrotor research lab and conduct
                        various research projects on quadrotor control</p>

                        <p> Outside of research, I invest most of my time into
                        food. I am an avid home cook and baker who enjoys exploring the well
                        established world of food. Though I am still working on most of the
                        fundamentals that any competent chef should master, I hope to one day
                        have the intuition and skill to write and execute my own recipes.</p>
                        <p> Overall, I enjoy playing tennis, drinking coffee and eating
                        at new places.
                        <p>Once upon a time, I also learned to blacksmith at
                        <a href="http://thecrucible.org/" target='blank'>The Crucible</a> and I would
                        love to get back into it to work on a collaborative project.</p>
                        <p>So if you share any of these interests, do not hesitate to contact me
                        so we can arrange to meet up!</p>
